## Expected characteristics (manual check)
- Step 1 is **[SR]** in the **original key** of the reviewed item (C).
- The plan **keeps** Focus=Progressions, SubFocus=I–IV–V, Key=C for **all core steps**.
- Only **micro-variations** allowed vs. yesterday: small tempo bump (+6–10 bpm if clean), +1 bar, or a tiny voice-leading cue — **not all**.
- No new harmonic layers (no borrowed chords/secondary dominants); stay with I–IV–V.
- 5–7 steps total; final step is **[MP]**.
- Each step includes Count/Tempo, Pattern (D/U), Bars, Repeat, Goal, and concrete fret/string positions (e.g., open C/G or A-shape C at 3rd fret).
- **ChordAscii** includes shapes actually used (e.g., `x32010` for C, `320003` for G, `xx0232` for D if referenced).
- **YouTubeSearchQuery** mentions something like “I IV V rhythm guitar in C voice leading”.
