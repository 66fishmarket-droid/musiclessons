# Learning Science Guidelines (SR / IL / MP)

Process rule: Respond with one completeable chunk at a time. Do not jump ahead. Wait for me to say ‘next’.

## Core boosters
- **[SR] Spaced Review** — Put as **Step 1**. Target the most recent item (≈14 days) marked `reinforce=true` or with `confidence ≤ 3`.  
  - **Key:** use the original key of that item. If it equals today’s TargetKey, keep it. Otherwise add a one-line note: “(SR stays in original key; rest of lesson in TargetKey)”.
  - **Duration:** 2–3 minutes.
  - **Task style:** replay the exact micro-skill with a tiny goal (clean transitions, steady click).

- **[IL] Interleaving** — Insert **one** short contrast mid-lesson from a different focus.  
  - **Duration:** 1–2 minutes.  
  - **Purpose:** refresh retrieval, avoid blocked practice.  
  - **Rule of one:** add **one** change only (e.g., different string-set OR a tiny rhythmic switch).

- **[MP] Mental Practice** — Last step.  
  - **Duration:** 60–90 seconds.  
  - **Cue:** breathe, count, visualise left-hand placements and right-hand motion; “air-strum” with counts.

## Dos & Don’ts
- **Do** keep total time **≤ 30 min**; write steps so they’re playable from text (Count, Pattern D/U, Bars, Repeats, Goal, positions/frets).
- **Do** use **continuous hand motion** and ghost strokes for ties.
- **Don’t** stack multiple new concepts in one step (esp. Tier ≥4: add **one** layer only).
- **Don’t** change key inside [SR]; keep SR in original key.

## Reinforcement policy
- When `needReinforce=true`, **pin** Focus + SubFocus + Key to yesterday’s values.
- Use **micro-variations only**: small tempo bump (+6–10 bpm if clean), +1 bar, or one tiny voice-leading cue.
- Spend **80–90%** of the time on the exact prior idea.

## Measuring success
- Each step must include a **measurable goal** (e.g., “4 bars × 4 reps at ♩=72, no timing drift”).
- Prefer **nearest-note transitions** (voice leading) over large jumps.
- If the user hits goals early, suggest a **single** optional “+” variation.

## Reference durations (by Tier)
- **Tier 1–2:** SR 3′, two core steps 8′ each, IL 2′, MP 1′ → ≈22–25′ total.
- **Tier 3:** SR 3′, three core steps 5–6′ each, IL 2′, MP 1′.
- **Tier 4–5:** SR 3′, three core steps 6–7′ each (one added layer), IL 2′, MP 1′.
