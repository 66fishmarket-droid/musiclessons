# Subfocus Catalog (canonical)

Process rule: Respond with one completeable chunk at a time. Do not jump ahead. Wait for me to say ‘next’.

Each SubFocus has: a short definition (why it matters for rhythm guitar), a suggested default Tier (1–5), and optional KeyHints.

---

## THEORY
- **Circle of Fifths** — Navigate closely related keys; fast transposition and functional progressions. _Tier 1_. **KeyHints:** open-friendly (C, G, D, A, E).
- **Intervals** — Audible distance awareness (2nds–octaves) to support voicing and harmony recognition. _Tier 1_.
- **Functional Harmony** — I/ii/iii/IV/V/vi roles; tonic–subdominant–dominant flow. _Tier 2–3_.
- **Cadences** — Perfect, plagal, deceptive cadences; how to end phrases convincingly. _Tier 2_.
- **Voice Leading (theory)** — Stepwise inner parts between chords; minimise movement. _Tier 3–4_.

## CAGED
- **Shapes overview** — Map C–A–G–E–D along neck; see chord forms everywhere. _Tier 1_. **KeyHints:** open-friendly.
- **Root finder** — Locate roots on 6th/5th/4th strings within each shape; anchor positions. _Tier 1–2_.
- **Triads (strings 1–3)** — Top-string triads for bright rhythm parts; inversion fluency. _Tier 2_.
- **Triads (strings 2–4)** — Mid-register triads for tighter band mixes. _Tier 2–3_.
- **Linking shapes** — Shift between adjacent CAGED forms via common tones. _Tier 3_.
- **Voice leading between shapes** — Smoothest movement across shapes in progressions. _Tier 3–4_.

## EXTENSIONS
- **Sus & add** — sus2/sus4, add9; colour without heavy re-voicing. _Tier 2_.
- **Seventh chords (maj7/min7/dom7)** — Shell voicings + complete sevenths for function clarity. _Tier 3_.
- **6ths & 9ths (shell voicings)** — Jazz/pop colours that remain playable in rhythm roles. _Tier 3–4_.
- **7sus4 & add9 embellishments** — Movement within a bar; tasteful suspensions/resolutions. _Tier 3–4_.

## GROOVE
- **Strum basics** — Continuous motion, down/up mapping, counting. _Tier 1_. **KeyHints:** open-friendly.
- **Accent patterns (backbeat/anticipations)** — Groove feel via accents ahead/behind the beat. _Tier 2_.
- **16ths with muting** — Right-hand control, ghost strokes, percussive feel. _Tier 3–4_.
- **Shuffle/swing feel** — Triplet grid; straight-to-swing conversion. _Tier 2–3_.
- **Metronome subdivisions** — Click on 2&4, offbeats, or barlines to internalise time. _Tier 2–4_.

## PROGRESSIONS
- **I–IV–V** — Bedrock progression; genre-agnostic comping. _Tier 1_.
- **I–V–vi–IV** — Modern pop cycle; smooth voice-leading options. _Tier 1–2_.
- **ii–V–I** — Functional turnaround; guide tones (3rds/7ths). _Tier 3_.
- **Turnarounds** — End-of-form movements; set up repeats/tags. _Tier 2–3_.
- **Modal interchange (iv, ♭VII)** — Borrowed colours; tasteful surprises. _Tier 4_.

## EAR
- **Intervals (sing/play)** — Sing/play 3rds, 4ths, 6ths against drone; map to fretboard. _Tier 1–2_.
- **Chord quality ID (maj/min/dom)** — Recognise chord quality quickly for comping choices. _Tier 2_.
- **Cadence recognition** — Identify perfect/plagal/deceptive endings by ear. _Tier 2–3_.
- **Call & response rhythm** — Echo 1–bar patterns; timing accuracy. _Tier 2–3_.

## CREATIVE
- **Rhythmic displacement** — Shift patterns against the bar; tension/release. _Tier 3–4_.
- **Pedal tones / drones** — Static note against moving harmony; cinematic textures. _Tier 3_.
- **Ostinato riffs** — Repeating hooks with harmonic motion above/below. _Tier 3–4_.
- **Chord-melody starter** — Top-line within chord shapes; simple harmonised melodies. _Tier 4–5_.
